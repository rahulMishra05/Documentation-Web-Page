In this project we had made a web page in which you can find documentations for different programming languages, markup languages and 
database languages along with some famous frame-works that are used in morden time to make application more interactive and 
responsive towards user.

You can get the whole file and source code in this repositry. If you want to run the web page then just download the whole file and 
then click on the "main.html" file.
